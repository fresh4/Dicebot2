				"The Snout of Omgar is a geographical region described briefly in Tomb of Annihilation. Not much is revealed about the location or its inhabitants in that adventure, however. The Tortle Package is written for Dungeon Masters who want to know more about the Snout of Omgar. This supplement also introduces a new playable character race, the tortle, and a new adventure location: Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace.",
				"Tortles are intelligent, turtle-like humanoids that have a knack for wilderness survival. The race first appeared in early editions of the D&D game, nowhere more prominently than in module X9, The Savage Coast, which was set in the world of Mystara. Tortles, like most other adventurous races, can appear on any D&D world. In the Forgotten Realms, the peninsula of Chult and the Snout of Omgar make good homes for them.",

				"The Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters, and Tomb of Annihilation contain stat blocks for most of the creatures found herein, and a handful of new monsters appear at the end of this supplement. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in the Monster Manual. If a stat block appears elsewhere, the text tells you so.",

						"The Snout of Omgar was once a peninsula, but upheaval wrought by the Spellplague broke off the tip of the peninsula, creating an island separated from mainland Chult by a narrow strait. When the separation occurred, tortles living in the vicinity claimed the island as their domain. The strait provided a natural defense against aggressive mainland predators.",
						"The tortles of the Snout are hospitable folk who like to hunt, catch fish, build things, and trade with visitors. Not long after the island was formed, a pirate ship captained by a cleric of the sea goddess Umberlee was caught in a typhoon and swept ashore. Tortles rescued the shipwrecked survivors and looked after them. The captain impressed the tortles with her magic and told stories that painted Umberlee in a flattering light. In time, she persuaded them to raise a palace in her deity's honor. The cleric chose a mountainside overlooking the sea, and there the tortles spent a decade building Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace, which secretly served as a temple of Umberlee. In return, the cleric and her followers left the tortles alone and were quiet neighbors.",
						"Over time, the island's Umberlee worshipers died off, and the palace fell into ruin. Descendants of the tortles who built the Typhoon Palace soon discovered evil creatures lurking within. Older tortles wisely shun the ruined palace, but younger tortles occasionally try to explore it as a rite of passage. Few of them get far before strange monsters frighten them away."

Zhanthi offers a 1,000 gp reward to adventurers who are willing to visit each of the island's landmarks and report back to her with news of their discoveries. Zhanthi gives them the map and arranges for a fast ship (the Brazen Pegasus) to transport them to the island.",

(\"Tortle hospitality is said to be second to none!\") Rumors that the ship fell prey to pirates are false; in fact, the ship capsized in a storm, and Volo was washed ashore on the Snout of Omgar."

He and a company of human treasure-hunters from the city of Athkatla were ambushed by yuan-ti, and Mudgraw was forced to abandon his companions. He hid in a ruin that was once a shrine to the god Ubtao, was transfixed by the maze-like imagery on the walls, and found a wooden holy symbol left behind by the shrine's previous inhabitants. He believes that Ubtao helped him escape the city and now wears the holy symbol around his neck. He regrets abandoning the expedition and prefers not to speak of it.
